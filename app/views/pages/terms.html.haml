        Before reading the remainder of this Agreement, Space Cooperative would like to introduce what we call the Fundamental Standard. The 
        %strong Fundamental Standard
        is the primary principle that Space Cooperative encourages its community members to follow, as well as the guiding philosophy behind the Space Cooperative global mission.  By familiarizing yourself with the Fundamental Standard you will be able to make an informed decision about whether to join our community.
        %h4 The Fundamental Standard
        %p Space Cooperative is a distributed alliance formed to encourage investment in space exploration endeavors. We believe that participants in the Space Cooperative community should embrace an attitude of open development and genuine collaboration.  We also believe that participants in this community should be rewarded for their sustained efforts toward the ends we all endorse collectively as part of Space Cooperative. 
        %p
        %p The Fundamental Standard, then, is the ambitious idea that Space Cooperative is a place where open development and collaboration are fairly rewarded by the community.
