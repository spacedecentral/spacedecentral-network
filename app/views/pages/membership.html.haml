          %span The purpose of the Space Decentral is to support the state-independent exploration, use and settlement of space. Space Decentral seeks to engage internationally all members of the human community who share a vision of a continual flourishing of both human and non-human life both on the Earth itself and spreading, like a green fire of creation, into the cosmos. Space Decentral will serve as a hub to tap into the potential of human creativity and collaboration across the globe, pooling our talents and resources to ensure long term commitment, autonomy, and shared responsibility for that vision. This hub provides the core of the Space Decentral as an international decentralized space program.
          %span Applications are required to become a core member (“Member”) and require a commitment of volunteering at least 20 hours a month to Space Decentral's activities. Other contributors (“Builders”) can openly volunteer without any minimum time commitment. We have limited slots available for core membership and invite you to apply. If you'd like to be a Builder, we invite you to simply join our #{link_to 'chatroom', 'https://keybase.io/team/spacedecentral.community', target: "_blank"} and let us know.
          %p.note Note: Your location does not matter, as we typically meet and collaborate virtually.
